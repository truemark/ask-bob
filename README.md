# Ask Bob

Ask Bob is a Generative AI reference implementation using AWS Bedrock. This reference implementation uses the
[Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) AI model hosted in [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
leveraging AWS Bedrock Agent and AWS Bedrock Knowledge bases for RAG (Response-Augmented Generation).

For an example using AWS Bedrock with LangChain using a custom RAG (Response-Augmented Generation) pipeline and
[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) for agent capability, see the
[Ask Alice](https://github.com/truemark/ask-alice) reference implementation.

If you are just starting out with AWS Bedrock and looking for simple examples to start with, see
[AWS Bedrock Basic Examples](https://github.com/erikrj/example-aws-bedrock-basic).

## Why this reference implementation written in TypeScript?

In our experience, TypeScript has been the least common denominator for our own and our customer's engineers. Nearly
all software engineers have at one time or another done JavaScript or TypeScript and TypeScript is reasonable for a
DevOps engineer who knows Python to pick up.
